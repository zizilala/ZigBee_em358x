 * Another case is when a device has missed a Network Key update and no 
 * longer has the current Network Key.  
 *
 * Note that a call to ::emberPollForData() on an end device that has lost
 * contact with its parent will automatically call ::emberRejoinNetwork(TRUE).
 *
 * The stack will call ::emberStackStatusHandler() to indicate that the network
 * is down, then try to re-establish contact with the network by performing
 * an active scan, choosing a network with matching extended pan id, and 
 * sending a ZigBee network rejoin request.  A second call to the 
 * ::emberStackStatusHandler() callback indicates either the success 
 * or the failure of the attempt.  The process takes
 * approximately 150 milliseconds per channel to complete.
 *
 * This call replaces the ::emberMobileNodeHasMoved() API from EmberZNet 2.x,
 * which used MAC association and consequently took half a second longer
 * to complete.
 *
 * @param haveCurrentNetworkKey  This parameter determines whether the request
 * to rejoin the Network is sent encrypted (TRUE) or unencrypted (FALSE).  The
 * application should first try to use encryption.  If that fails,
 * the application should call this function again and use no encryption.  
 * If the unencrypted rejoin is successful then device will be in the joined but 
 * unauthenticated state.  The Trust Center will be notified of the rejoin and
 * send an updated Network encrypted using the device's Link Key.  Sending the
 * rejoin unencrypted is only supported on networks using Standard Security
 * with link keys (i.e. ZigBee 2006 networks do not support it).
 *
 * @param channelMask A mask indicating the channels to be scanned.  
 * See ::emberStartScan() for format details.
 *
 * @param reason An enemuration indicating why the rejoin occurred.
 * The stack will set the reason based on the ::EmberRejoinReason.
 * An application should use one of the APP_EVENT rejoin reasons.  The stack
 * will never use these.  Only if the function return code is EMBER_SUCCESS
 * will the rejoin reason be set.

  * from 11 to 26 inclusive.  This translates to a channel mask value of 0x07
