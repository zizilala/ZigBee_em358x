 /** @addtogroup serial_comm
 * Unless otherwise noted, the EmberNet stack does not use these functions, 
 * and therefore the HAL is not required to implement them. However, many of
 * the supplied example applications do use them.  On some platforms, they are
 * also required by DEBUG builds of the stack
 * 
 * Many of these functions return an ::EmberStatus value. See 
 * stack/include/error-defs.h for definitions of all ::EmberStatus return values.
 * See app/util/serial/serial.h for source code.
 *  To use these serial routines, they must be properly configured. 
 * 
 * If the Ember serial library is built using EMBER_SERIAL_USE_STDIO,
 * then the Ember serial code will redirect to stdio.h.  EMBER_SERIAL_USE_STDIO
 * will not consume any of the usual Ember serial library buffers and does
 * not require use of any of the other EMBER_SERIALx definitions described
 * here. In this mode, the only required lower layers are:
 * - putchar()
 * - getchar()
 * - fflush(stdout)
 * - halInternalUartInit()
 * - halInternalPrintfWriteAvailable()
 * - halInternalPrintfReadAvailable()
 * - halInternalForcePrintf()
 *
 *  The functions can work in two ways, depending on how messages waiting for 
 *  transmission are stored:
 *  - Buffered mode: Uses stack linked buffers. This method can be more
 *  efficient if many messages received over the air also need to be
 *  transmitted over the serial interface.
 *  - FIFO mode: Uses a statically allocated queue of bytes, and data
 *  to be transmitted is copied into the queue.
 * 
 * (These modes deal only with data transmission. Data \b reception 
 *  always occurs in a FIFO mode.)
 * 
 *  The current version of these sources provides support for as many as two
 *  serial ports, but it can be easily extended. The ports are numbered 0
 *  and 1 and should be accessed using those numbers. The ports can be set up 
 *  independently of each other.
 * 
 *  To enable a port, a Use mode (buffered or FIFO) and a Queue Size must be 
 *  declared on the port. In FIFO mode, the Queue Size is the size of the FIFO and 
 *  represents the number of bytes that can be waiting for transmission at any 
 *  given time. In buffered mode, the Queue Size represents the number of whole
 *  messages that can be waiting for transmission at any given time. A single 
 *  message is created for each call to any of the serial APIs.
 *  
 *  To specify a Use mode and Queue Size, place declarations in the compiler 
 *  preprocessor options when building your application:
 *  - <b>Use Mode:</b>
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL0_MODE=::EMBER_SERIAL_BUFFER or ::EMBER_SERIAL_FIFO
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL1_MODE=::EMBER_SERIAL_BUFFER or ::EMBER_SERIAL_FIFO
 *  - <b>Queue Size:</b>
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL0_TX_QUEUE_SIZE=2
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL0_RX_QUEUE_SIZE=4
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL1_TX_QUEUE_SIZE=8
 *    -  ::EMBER_SERIAL1_RX_QUEUE_SIZE=16
 *
 *  Note the following: 
 *  - If buffered mode is declared, emberSerialBufferTick() should be 
 *  called in the application's main event loop.
 *  - If buffered mode is declared, the Tx queue size \b MUST be <= 255
 *  - On the AVR platform, Rx & Tx queue sizes are limited to powers of 2 <= 128
 *  - By default, both ports are unused.
 *
 *  You can also use declarations to specify what should be done if an attempt
 *  is made to send more data than the queue can accommodate:
 *  - ::EMBER_SERIAL0_BLOCKING
 *  - ::EMBER_SERIAL1_BLOCKING
 *
 *  Be aware that since blocking spins in a loop, doing nothing until space 
 *  is available, it can adversely affect any code that has tight timing 
 *  requirements.
 *
 *  If ::EMBER_SERIAL0_BLOCKING or ::EMBER_SERIAL1_BLOCKING is defined,
 *  then the call to the port will block until space
 *  is available, guaranteeing that the entire message is sent. Note that 
 *  in buffered mode, even if blocking mode is in effect entire messages
 *  may be dropped if insufficient stack buffers are available to hold them.
 *  When this happens, ::EMBER_NO_BUFFERS is returned.
 *  
 *  If no blocking mode is defined, the serial code defaults to non-blocking
 *  mode. In this event, when the queue is too short, the data that don't fit 
 *  are dropped. In FIFO mode, this may result bytes being dropped,
 *  starting in the middle of message. In buffered mode, the entire
 *  message is dropped. When data is dropped, ::EMBER_SERIALTX_OVERFLOW 
 *  is returned. 
 *
 *  To minimize code size, very little error checking is done on
 *  the given parameters. Specifying an invalid or unused serial port may
 *  result in unexplained behavior. In some cases ::EMBER_ERR_FATAL may be 
 *  returned.
