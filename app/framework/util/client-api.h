 *
 * Fills the outgoing zcl buffer and returns the number
 * of bytes used in a buffer. The buffers used are the
 * ones that were previously set with emberAfSetExternalBuffer.
 *
 * @param frameControl byte used for frame control
 * @param clusterId cluster id of message
 * @param commandId command id of message
 * @param format String format for further arguments to the function.
 *   Format values are: 
 *     - '0' -- '9' and 'A' -- 'G': Pointer to a buffer contain 0--16 raw
 *            bytes.  The data is copied as is to the destination buffer.
 *     - 'u': int8u.
 *     - 'v': int16u.  The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'x': int24u.  The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'w': int32u.  The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'l': Pointer to a buffer containing a ZigBee long string, with the
 *            first two bytes of the buffer specifying the length of the string
 *            data in little-endian format.  The length bytes and the string
 *            itself are both included as is in the destination buffer.
 *     - 's': Pointer to a buffer containing a ZigBee string, with the first
 *            byte of the buffer specifying the length of the string data.  The
 *            length byte and the string itself are both included as is in the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'L': Pointer to a buffer containing a long string followed by an
 *            int16u specifying the length of the string data.  The length
 *            bytes in little-endian format will precede the string itself in
 *            the destination buffer.
 *     - 'S': Pointer to a buffer containing a string followed by an int8u
 *            specifying the length of the string data.  The length byte will
 *            precede the string itself in the destination buffer.
 *     - 'b': Pointer to a buffer containing a sequence of raw bytes followed
 *            by an int16u specifying the length of the data.  The data is
 *            copied as is to the destination buffer.  The length is not
