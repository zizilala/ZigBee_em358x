 *
 * This file describes the functions necessary to manage security for a
 * regular device.  There are three major modes for security and applications
 * should link in the appropriate library:
 * - Residential security uses only network keys.  This is the only supported
 *     option for ZigBee 2006 devices.
 * - Standard security uses network keys with optional link keys.  Ember
 *     strongly recommends using Link Keys.  It is possible for 2006 devices
 *     to run on a network that uses Standard Security.
 * - High Security uses network keys and requires link keys derived via SKKE.
 *     Devices that do not support link keys (i.e. 2006 devices) are not 
 *     allowed.  High Security also uses Entity Authentication to synchronize
 *     frame counters between neighboring devices and children.
 *
 * See security.h for source code.

/** @brief This function sets the initial security state that will be used by 
 * the device when it forms or joins a network.  If security is enabled then
 * this function <b>must</b> be called prior to forming or joining the network.
 * It must also be called if the device left the network and wishes to form 
 * or join another network.
 *
 * This call <b>should not</b> be used when restoring prior network operation
 * from saved state via ::emberNetworkInit as this will cause saved 
 * security settings and keys table from the prior network to be erased,
 * resulting in improper keys and/or frame counter values being used, which will
 * prevent proper communication with other devices in the network.
 * Calling ::emberNetworkInit is sufficient to restore all saved security
 * settings after a reboot and re-enter the network.
 *
 * The call may be used by either the Trust Center or non Trust Center devices,
 * the options that are set are different depending on which role the device
 * will assume.  See the ::EmberInitialSecurityState structure for more
 * explanation about the various security settings.
 *
 * The function will return ::EMBER_SECURITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID
 * in the following cases:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>Distributed Trust Center Mode was enabled with Hashed Link Keys.</li>
 *   <li>High Security was specified.</li>

 * @return An ::EmberStatus value.  ::EMBER_SUCCESS if the security

 *   ::EMBER_SECURITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID is returned if the combination
 *   of security parameters is not valid.  ::EMBER_KEY_INVALID is returned
 *   if a reserved or invalid key value was passed in the key structure for
 *   one of the keys.
