description=This plugin will periodically update the battery voltage attribute in the power configuration tab.  It does so based on the battery voltage when we are transmitting.  Note that because this consumes a bit of energy, we don't recommend doing this all the time.  To use this, you must configure PC5 as an alternate output with push/pull drive, you must include PC5 as a wake on interrupt pin in your board.h file, and you must set the PHY_CONFIG token to one of the external PA drive options.
