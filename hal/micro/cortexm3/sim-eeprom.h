 * By default, the EM35x Simulated EEPROM is designed to consume 8kB of
 * upper flash within which it will perform wear leveling.  It is possible
 * to reduce the reserved flash to only 4kB by defining EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_4KB
 * when building your application.
 *
 * While there is no specific ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_8KB, it is possible to use
 * the define ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_8KB for clarity in your application.
 *
 * @note Switching between an 8kB and 4kB Simulated EEPROM should be done
 * by rebuilding the entire application to ensure all sources recognize
 * the change.  The Simualted EEPROM is designed to seamlessly move
 * between 8kB and 4kB without erasing flash first.
 *
 * \b
 *
 * @note Switching between 8kB and 4kB Simulated EEPROM will <b>
 * automatically erase all </b> Simulated EEPROM tokens and reload
 * them from default values.

 * @note <b>Simulated EEPROM 2 is only available for use in the NCP.</b>
 * @note Simulated EEPROM and Simulated EEPROM 2 functions cannot be
 * intermixed; SimEE and SimEE2 are mutually exclusive.  The functions
 * in @ref simeeprom cannot be used with
 * SimEE2 and the functons in @ref simeeprom2 cannot be used
 * with SimEE.
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM 2 system (typically referred to as SimEE2) is
 * designed to operate under the @ref tokens
 * API and provide a non-volatile storage system.  Since the flash write cycles
 * are finite, the SimEE2's primary purpose is to perform wear
 * leveling across several hardware flash pages, ultimately increasing the
 * number of times tokens may be written before a hardware failure.
 *
 * Compiling the application with the define EMBER_SIMEE2 will switch
 * the application from using the original SimEE to SimEE2.
 *
 * @note Only the NCP is capable of upgrading it's existing SimEE data
 * to SimEE2.  It's not possible to downgrade from SimEE2.
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM 2 needs to periodically perform a page erase 
 * operation to reclaim storage area for future token writes.  The page
 * erase operation requires an ATOMIC block of 21ms.  Since this is such a long
 * time to not be able to service any interrupts, the page erase operation is
 * under application control providing the application the opportunity to
 * decide when to perform the operation and complete any special handling
 * that might be needed.
 *
 * @note The best, safest, and recommended practice is for the application
 * to regularly and always call the function halSimEeprom2ErasePage() when the
 * application can expect and deal with the page erase delay.
 * halSimEeprom2ErasePage() will immediately return if there is nothing to
 * erase.  If there is something that needs to be erased, doing so
 * as regularly and as soon as possible will keep the SimEE2 in the
 * healthiest state possible.
 *
 * SimEE2  differs from the
 * original SimEE in terms of size and speed.  SimEE2 holds more data
 * but at the expense of consuming more overall flash to support a new
 * wear levelling technique.  SimEE2's worst case execution time under
 * normal behavior is faster and finite, but the average execution time is
 * longer.
 *
 * See hal/micro/cortexm3/sim-eeprom.h for source code.

/** @brief The Simulated EEPROM 2 callback function, implemented by the

 *
 * @param status  An ::EmberStatus error code indicating one of the conditions
 * described below.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN whenever a token is set and a page needs
 * to be erased.  If the main application loop does not periodically
 * call halSimEeprom2ErasePage(), it is best to then erase a page in
 * response to ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED
 * when the pages <i>must</i> be erased to prevent data loss.
 * halSimEeprom2ErasePage() needs to be called until it returns 0 to indicate
 * there are no more pages that need to be erased.  Ignoring
 * this indication and not erasing the pages will cause dropping the new data
 * trying to be written.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL when
 * the new data cannot be written due to unerased pages.  <b>Not erasing
 * pages regularly, not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN, or not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED will cause
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL and the new data will be lost!.</b>  Any future
 * write attempts will be lost as well.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_REPAIRING
 * when the Simulated EEPROM 2 needs to repair itself.  While there's nothing
 * for an app to do when the SimEE2 is going to repair itself (SimEE2 has to
 * be fully functional for the rest of the system to work), alert the
 * application to the fact that repairing is occuring.  There are debugging
 * scenarios where an app might want to know that repairing is happening;
 * such as monitoring frequency.
 * @note  Common situations will trigger an expected repair, such as using
 *        a new chip or changing token definitions.
 *
 * If the callback ever reports the status ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED or
 * ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED, this indicates a catastrophic failure in
 * flash writing, meaning either the address being written is not empty or the
 * write itself has failed.  If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED is 
 * encountered, the function ::halInternalSimEeRepair(FALSE) should be called 
 * and the chip should then be reset to allow proper initialization to recover.
 * If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED is encountered the Simulated EEPROM 2 (and
 * tokens) on the specific chip with this error should not be trusted anymore.

/** @brief Gets a pointer to the token data.  
 *
 * @note This function only works on Cortex-M3 chips since it requires
 * being able to return a pointer to flash memory.
 *
 * @note Only the public function should be called since the public
 * function provides the correct parameters.
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM uses a RAM Cache
 * to hold the current state of the Simulated EEPROM, including the location
 * of the freshest token data.  This function simply uses the ID and
 * index parameters to access the pointer RAM Cache.  The absolute flash
 * address stored in the pointer RAM Cache is extracted and ptr is
 * set to this address. 
 *
 * Here is an example of calling this function:
 * @code
 * tokTypeStackCalData calData = {0,};
 * tokTypeStackCalData *calDataToken = &calData;
 * halStackGetIdxTokenPtrOrData(&calDataToken,
 *                              TOKEN_STACK_CAL_DATA,
 *                              index);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param ptr  A pointer to where the absolute address of the data should 
 * be placed.
 *
 * @param ID    The ID of the token to get data from.  Since the token system
 * is designed to enumerate the token names down to a simple 8 bit ID,
 * generally the TOKEN_name is the parameter used when invoking this function.
 *
 * @param index If token being accessed is indexed, this parameter is
 * combined with the ID to formulate both the RAM Cache lookup as well
 * as the desired InfoWord to look for.  If the token is not an indexed token,
 * this parameter is ignored.
 *
 * @param len   The number of bytes being worked on.  This should always be
 * the size of the token (available from both the sizeof() intrinsic as well
 * as the tokenSize[] array).
