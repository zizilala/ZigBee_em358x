// * drlc-server.h
// *
// * This is an implementation of a drlc server which is intended to 
// * be used for testing only. Generally it is expected that the drlc
// * server will act as a passthrough for drlc events and will not maintain
// * a list of scheduled events of its own. However for testing purposes
// * it is highly useful to have the server store scheduled events so that
// * - minus a backend - the ESP can respond to get scheduled events
// * commands.
// * 
// * There are a couple things about
// * this code that make it incomplete as an actual drlc server table
// *
// * 1. Scheduled events are not stored in persistent memory, which they
// *    would have to be if this were intended for an ESP which for some
// *    reason were storing events.
// *
// * Note: The EmberAfLoadControlEvent source field is used by the plugin as a
// * status field.  If the first byte is set to 0xFF, then the event is
// * considered inactive,  If it is set to 0x00, then the event is considered
// * active.  Other bytes are used internally.
