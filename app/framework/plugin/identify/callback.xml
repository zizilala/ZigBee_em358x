      This function is called by the Identify plugin when identification begins. It informs the Identify Feedback plugin that it should begin providing its implemented feedback functionality (e.g. LED blinking, buzzer sounding, etc.) until the Identify plugin tells it to stop. The identify time is purely a matter of informational convenience; this plugin does not need to know how long it will identify (the Identify plugin will perform the necessary timekeeping.)
