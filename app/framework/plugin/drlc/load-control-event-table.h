// * The Demand Response Load Control Event Table is responsible 
// * for keeping track of all load control events scheduled
// * by the Energy Service Provider. This module provides
// * interfaces used to schedule and inform load shedding
// * devices of scheduled events.
// *
// * Any code that uses this event table is responsible for
// * providing four things:
// *   1. frequent calls to eventTableTick(), one per millisecond
// *      will do. These calls are used to drive the 
// *      table's timing mechanism.
// *   2. A way to get the real time by implementing 
// *      getCurrentTime(int32u *currentTime);
// *   3. An implementation of eventAction which
// *      will be called whenever event status changes
// * 
// * The load control event table expects that currentTime, startTime
// * and randomization are provided in seconds. And that duration is 
// * provided in minutes. 
// *
// * The implementing code is responsible for over the
// * air communication based on event status changes
// * reported through the eventAction interface
