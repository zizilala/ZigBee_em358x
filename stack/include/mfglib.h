 * @brief This is a manufacturing and functional test library for
 * testing and verifying the RF component of products at manufacture time.
 *
 * See mfglib.h for source code.
 *
 * Developers can optionally include this library in their
 * application code. The goal is that in most cases, this will
 * eliminate the need for developers to load multiple images into
 * their hardware at manufacturing time.
 *
 * This library can optionally be compiled into the developer's
 * production code and run at manufacturing time. Any interface to
 * the library is handled by the application.
 * 
 * This library cannot assist in hardware start up.
 *
 * Many functions in this file return an ::EmberStatus value.  See
 * error-def.h for definitions of all  ::EmberStatus return values.
