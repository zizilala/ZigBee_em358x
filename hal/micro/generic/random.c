  the stdlib rand() takes about 2.25ms @3.68MHz on the AVR
  hell- you can run an software implimentation AES cipher block in 1.5ms!
  obviously an LFSR method is much faster (12us on a 4MHz 128AVR actually).
  in the FPGA we did the first poly you see here but on a 32bit seed, 
  taking only the msb word, but we quickly noticed a sequential nature 
  in the output. so at each random number generation we actually ran the 
  LFSR 16 times. we can avoid that but still remove the sequential nature 
  and get a good looking spread by running two LFSRs and XORing them.
