// File: source-route.c
//
// Description: Example code for managing source routes on a node-based gateway.
// For host-based gateways refer to source-route-host.c.
//
// New source routes are added to the table in the
// emberIncomingRouteRecordHandler() callback. Adding a route results in routes
// to all intermediate relays as well.
//
// For every outgoing packet, the stack calls emberAppendSourceRouteHandler().
// If a source route to the destination is found, it is added to the packet.
//
// In this implementation, the maximum table size is 255 entries since a
// one-byte index is used and the index 0xFF is reserved.

// ZigBee protocol limitations effectively constrain us to a 11-hop source route
// in the worst case scenario (for a 12-hop delivery in total), so we enforce
// a threshold value on the relayCount and ignore source route operations beyond
// this threshold.  See explanatory comment in emberAppendSourceRouteHandler()
// for more details about this.
// This value could be reduced at the designer's discretion, but not increased
// beyond 11 without causing routing problems.
