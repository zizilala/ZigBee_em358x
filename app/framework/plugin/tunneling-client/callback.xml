  <function id="TUNNELING_CLIENT_TUNNEL_CLOSED" name="Tunnel Closed" returnType="void">
    <description> 
      This function is called by the Tunneling client plugin whenever a server sends a notification that it preemptively closed an inactive tunnel.  Servers are not required to notify clients of tunnel closures, so applications cannot rely on this callback being called for all tunnels.
