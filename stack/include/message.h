/** @brief Sends a route request packet that creates routes from
 * every node in the network back to this node.  
 *
 * This function should be
 * called by an application that wishes to communicate with
 * many nodes, for example, a gateway, central monitor, or controller.
 * A device using this function was referred to as an "aggregator" in
 * EmberZNet 2.x and earlier, and is referred to as a "concentrator"
 * in the ZigBee specification and EmberZNet 3.
 * 
 * This function enables large scale networks, because the other devices
 * do not have to individually perform bandwidth-intensive route discoveries.  
 * Instead, when a remote node sends an APS unicast to a concentrator, its
 * network layer automatically delivers a special route record packet first,
 * which lists the network ids of all the intermediate relays.
 * The concentrator can then use source routing to send outbound APS unicasts.
 * (A source routed message is one in which the entire route is listed in 
 * the network layer header.)  This allows the concentrator to communicate
 * with thousands of devices without requiring large route tables on
 * neighboring nodes.
 *
 * This function is only available in ZigBee Pro (stack profile 2),
 * and cannot be called on end devices.  Any router can be a concentrator
 * (not just the coordinator), and there can be multiple concentrators on
 * a network.
 *
 * Note that a concentrator does not automatically obtain routes to all network
 * nodes after calling this function.  Remote applications must first initiate 
 * an inbound APS unicast.
 * 
 * Many-to-one routes are not repaired automatically.  Instead, the concentrator
 * application must call this function to rediscover the routes as necessary,
 * for example, upon failure of a retried APS message.  The reason for this
 * is that there is no scalable one-size-fits-all route repair strategy.
 * A common and recommended strategy is for the concentrator application to
 * refresh the routes by calling this function periodically.
 *
 * @param concentratorType   Must be either ::EMBER_HIGH_RAM_CONCENTRATOR or 
 * ::EMBER_LOW_RAM_CONCENTRATOR.  The former is used when the caller has
 * enough memory to store source routes for the whole network.  In that
 * case, remote nodes stop sending route records once the concentrator has
 * successfully received one.  The latter is used when the concentrator 
 * has insufficient RAM to store all outbound source routes.  In that
 * case, route records are sent to the concentrator prior to every inbound
 * APS unicast.
 *
 * @param radius             The maximum number of hops the route request will be
 * relayed.  A radius of zero is converted to ::EMBER_MAX_HOPS.
 *
 * @return ::EMBER_SUCCESS if the route request was successfully submitted to
 * the transmit queue, and ::EMBER_ERR_FATAL otherwise.

 * error message and returned it to us along the many-to-one route.
 *
 * A status of ::EMBER_MANY_TO_ONE_ROUTE_FAILURE also occurs only
 * if we are a concentrator, and indicates that
 * a unicast sent to us along a many-to-one route 
 * encountered a broken link.  The node prior to the broken
 * link generated the route error message and forwarded it
 * to us via a randomly chosen neighbor, taking advantage
 * of the many-to-one nature of the route.
 *
 * A status of ::EMBER_MAC_INDIRECT_TIMEOUT indicates that a
 * message sent to the target end device could not be delivered
 * by the parent because the indirect transaction timer expired.
 * Upon receipt of the route error, the stack sets the extended
 * timeout for the target node in the address table, if present.
 * It then calls this handler to indicate receipt of the error.
 *
 * Note that if the original unicast data message is sent using
 * the ::EMBER_APS_OPTION_RETRY option, a new route error message
 * is generated for each failed retry.  Thus it is not unusual
 * to receive three route error messages in succession for a 
 * single failed retried APS unicast.  On the other hand, it is also
 * not guaranteed that any route error messages will be
