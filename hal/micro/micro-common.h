 * - SLEEPMODE_RUNNING
 *     Everything is active and running.  In practice this mode is not
 *     used, but it is defined for completeness of information.
 * - SLEEPMODE_IDLE
 *     Only the CPU is idled.  The rest of the chip continues running
 *     normally.  The chip will wake from any interrupt.
 * - SLEEPMODE_WAKETIMER
 *     The sleep timer clock sources remain running.  The RC is always
 *     running and the 32kHz XTAL depends on the board header.  Wakeup
 *     is possible from both GPIO and the sleep timer.  System time
 *     is maintained.  The sleep timer is assumed to be configured
 *     properly for wake events.
 * - SLEEPMODE_MAINTAINTIMER
 *     The sleep timer clock sources remain running.  The RC is always
 *     running and the 32kHz XTAL depends on the board header.  Wakeup
 *     is possible from only GPIO.  System time is maintained.
 *       NOTE: This mode is not available on EM2XX chips.
 * - SLEEPMODE_NOTIMER
 *     The sleep timer clock sources (both RC and XTAL) are turned off.
 *     Wakeup is possible from only GPIO.  System time is lost.
