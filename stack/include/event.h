/**
 * @addtogroup event
 *
 * These macros implement an event abstraction that allows the application
 * to schedule code to run after some specified time interval.  An event
 * consists of a procedure to be called at some point in the future and
 * a control object that determines the procedure should be called.  Events
 * are also useful for when an ISR needs to initiate an action that should
 * run outside of ISR context.
 *
 * See event.h for source code.
 *
 * Note that while not required, it is recommended that the event-handling procedure 
 * explicitly define the recurrence of the next event, either by rescheduling
 * it via some kind of @e emberEventControlSetDelayXX() call or by deactivating it
 * via a call to ::emberEventControlSetInactive().
 * In cases where the handler does not explicitly reschedule or cancel the 
 * event, the default behavior of the event control system is to keep the 
 * event immediately active as if the handler function had called  
 * ::emberEventControlSetActive(someEvent) or
 * ::emberEventControlSetDelayMS(someEvent, EMBER_EVENT_ZERO_DELAY)
 *
 * The time units are all in 'binary'
 * One 'millisecond' is 1/1024 of a second.
 * One 'quarter second' is 256 milliseconds (which happens to work out to be
 *                                           the same as a real quarter second)
 * One 'minute' is 65536 (0x10000) milliseconds (64 * 4 'quarter seconds').  
 * The accuracy of the base 'millisecond' depends on your timer source.
 *
 * Following are some brief usage examples.
 * @code
 * EmberEventControl delayEvent;
 * EmberEventControl signalEvent;
 * EmberEventControl periodicEvent;
 *
 * void delayEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   // Disable this event until its next use.
 *   emberEventControlSetInactive(delayEvent);
 * }
 *
 * void signalEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   // Disable this event until its next use.
 *   emberEventControlSetInactive(signalEvent);
 *
 *   // Sometimes we need to do something 100 ms later.
 *   if (somethingIsExpected)
 *     emberEventControlSetDelayMS(delayEvent, 100);
 * }
 *
 * void periodicEventHandler(void)
 * {
 *   emberEventControlSetDelayQS(periodicEvent, 4);
 * }
 *
 * void someIsr(void)
 * {
 *   // Set the signal event to run at the first opportunity.
 *   emberEventControlSetActive(signalEvent);
 * }
 *
 * // Put the controls and handlers in an array.  They will be run in
 * // this order.
 * EmberEventData events[] =
 *  {
 *    { &delayEvent,    delayEventHandler },
 *    { &signalEvent,   signalEentHandler },
 *    { &periodicEvent, periodicEventHandler },
 *    { NULL, NULL }                            // terminator
 *  };
 *
 * void main(void)
 * {
 *   // Cause the periodic event to occur once a second.
 *   emberEventControlSetDelayQS(periodicEvent, 4);
 *   
 *   while (TRUE) {
 *     emberRunEvents(events);
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
